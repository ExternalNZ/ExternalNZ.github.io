### Preparation
Before you can make an awesome GitHub site, you'll need a cool but relevant username or GitHub.io domain.
Find some words, names or objects that really butters your bread. Go wholegrain and mix it up with some verb-noun combos if you need. Originally I tried playing around with the words `sudo`, `psuedo` and `pseudonym`. After getting myself tongue-twisted once or twice, I almost said cinnamon instead of pseudonym. Jokingly I said `pseudonym toast` and realised it didn't sound half bad and so I went with it.

### Gather the Ingredients
Now that you have a sweet name to make the internet go doughy over, let's try and cook up some complimentary side dishes.
#### Shopping List
 - Logo & Favicon
 - Site Purpose
 - <s>&frac12;cup choc chips</s>
 - Design Ideas
 - Assets (Imagery/Styling)
 - Homepage Banner

### Step 1. Logo & Favicon
Once I had the name, it seemed straightforward to use a piece of toast as the logo. Throw a bit of text on either side and done!
Though sounding simple, I did fiddle in Phototshop for a good hour to figure out what I liked.
Make sure the colours of the logo suit you too, as this will help determine the colour theme of your site.

### Step 2. Site Purpose
Before we can start adding the flavours and fine-grain detail, we have to sort out our base mixture.<br/>
What is your primary goal with the site?<br/>
- Become an influencer and make internet monies
- Have a place to express my ideas and interests
- Get baked and watch *Fifty Shades of Grain* because that's how I roll
- I already have some GitHub repositories but would like a site to showcase them on
- Be the best thing since sliced bread and rake in all the dough
- Speak freely because (bread)sticks and scones won't break my bones!

Let's go with `Have a place to express my ideas and interests` - seems like a good starting point.

### Step 3. Design Ideas
So now that we have the purpose sorted, let's figure out what we need in our site to support that purpose. I have collections of code snippets and portions of code projects I've worked on that I'd like to shine a light on. My peculiar taste in jokes and puns deserves a shopfront window to deliver my produce (<a href="/#joke">example</a>) so this will assume that role nicely.<br />
I've also had more than a baker's dozen people ask me how I'm holding up during my country's coronavirus pandemic so I've also decided to add a basic diary to keep my friends, family and anyone else I break bread with up to date on our daily loafstyle while we're stuck in self-isolation.

### Step 4. Assets
Images and well-matched colours really make a website pop! I like to make use of Unsplash for some free imagery and then whip up some photoshop-assisted imagery tailored to my site design. This site you're on will age and mature over time as I improve my ingrediants and dig in to get some more fine-grain control over the aesthetics.

### Step 5. Homepage Banner
This last step has its own place separate to that of the other imagery as this is the face of your site. As the first thing someone will see and remember, you want your banner lightly-bronzed and showcasing your baked goods front and center.
For me this is my logo on a nice wooden chopping board with some added shadow to make it really soak into the scene.

### Final Step
That's it, you're now a `sous-chef de interwebs` which is French for ***I know my stuff*** ;P
