Fri 28 Feb, 2020
:   We're attended our friends' wedding in the Canterbury region. Weather is set to be perfect although a bit chilly.
Sitting here with the guests chatting about the coronavirus situation *(the first confirmed case of the COVID-19 coronavirus has just been discovered in NZ)* and how it feels like a prelude to our own version of the Tomorrow When The War Began story. While we are out here in the wilderness enjoying some open air and beautiful scenery, the rest of the country is starting to go into a panic and clearing stores of their toilet paper and hand sanitisers. It was already happening before but now it's reached a new level of chaos. Looking forward to a great wedding tomorrow though and not gonna let anything spoil the serenity we have out here.

Sat 29 Feb, 2020
:    After a cold morning of rain and wind the skies have cleared and we're looking at a perfect day to have a wedding.
It's all hands on deck but also a good level of chill with happy faces everywhere.
A bit later in the afternoon we can hear more talks about coronavirus going on but we're too busy watching the latest Dr Who episodes to worry about it.<br />
Move forward a few hours - the wedding was amazing! We're all chilling out in a heated tent having some food, drink and live music.
Only downside was all the best desserts seemed to be dairy and being remote as we are, this would not be a great time to trigger my lactose intolerance. That aside, the rest of the feast more than made up for what I couldn't eat.

Sun 1 Mar, 2020
:   Last day in the Christchurch region :( But we've had a great time. Helped pack and clean up the function venue and then made our way back into Christchurch to finish off our exploring of the inner city before our flight back to Wellington.

:   We've been caring for our friends cat which for the last few days has been AWOL. He turned up at our old property today and in the rescue trip, fought for his freedom and managed to punctured Maree's thumb and finger to quite a surprising depth. Keeping it clean and protected but gotta keep a close eye on it. Fortunately, she's a left-hander so it's not affected her day to day too much although her artwork has taken a bit of a hit.<br />

Tue 3 Mar, 2020
:   It's quite a calm day today. The weather is clear and there's a nice family of starlings chilling on the fence outside the bedroom window. 

Wed 4 Mar, 2020
:   Okay, so the cat bite has taken a turn for the worse and it's looking a little gnarly today. Maree's getting a tetanus shot and a couple week antibiotics to knock it back. Turns out a cat bite is considerably worse than a dog bite when it comes to infections.

Fri 6 Mar, 2020
:   Unless this coronavirus turns NZ on its head, I'm looking forward to a busy but exciting work trip to Auckland at the end of the month. We've got a nice afternoon of games planned for tomorrow. 

Sat 7 Mar, 2020
:   Had some good board game sessions with a group of friends this afternoon and then finished by watching the new Sonic movie before heading back home.

Sun 8 Mar, 2020
:   Went for a lovely trip down to see the ducks at local pond while we ate some hot chips and nibbles.

Mon 9 Mar, 2020
:   Maree's hand is beginning to look a lot better now and she's able to get some more use out of it.

Sat 14 Mar, 2020
:   A quiet weekend to ourselves. Had some social plans but they fell through so we're just relaxing and enjoying the peacefulness.

Mon 16 Mar, 2020
:   So I'm pretty sure our company just ordered **$3000 of hand sanitiser**... *(amongst other things but mostly the sanitiser)*
Local supermarkets are stripped clean of toilet paper and personal cleaning items. It's a cold and windy one today, too. Can feel the draft blast though as soon as the front door is used.

Thu 19 Mar, 2020
:   A dozen of our helpdesk staff are trialing working from home today. Fingers crossed this goes according to plan.
Pretty sure my work trip to Auckland is going to be a no-go. If it does go ahead I'll likely be driving myself up as I'm quite certain domestic flights are going to be closed soon.

Fri 20 Mar, 2020
:   As of midnight tonight, NZ is closing its borders to all non-residents and non-New Zealand citizens.
The roads are already starting to clear up and look more like a saturday morning rather than a Friday afternoon.
Meanwhile, we've got a visitor ;) Haven't seen one of these guys for a while! (Stick insect picture here soon)

Sat 21 Mar, 2020
:   As expected, domestic flights are now cancelled in NZ. They are now beginning to police the roads to prevent unnecessary travellers roaming the countryside. Trip to Auckland for work project formally postponed. Keeping my feet in Wellington and riding this virus out.

Sun 22 Mar, 2020
:   Trend Micro have done us a solid. If your staff are working from personal devices while working from home this may be worth having a look into.<br />

Mon 23 Mar, 2020
:   A parcel arrived at work today from a location in China quite near Wuhan...<br />Given that it was some Aliexpress stylus order, we'll probably take the safe route and not bother with it :P<br />
Suppliers are now out of their last handfuls of wifi adapters and dongles as the rest of the nation is moving to working from home.

Tue 24 Mar, 2020
:   There was a lovely downpour of rain overnight. Listening to it hitting the tin roof was nothing but peaceful

Wed 25 Mar, 2020
:   Shoppers are reporting their regular shopping list has jumped as much as 40% within the last month<br />
*"The feedback I am getting is that prices are gone beyond what people can afford. Rice, mince, hand sanitiser...all those essentials."*<br />
This means those on lower incomes are potentially going without yet Countdown said it had not increased its prices.<br />
*"We haven't put any of our standard shelf prices up in any Countdown store across the country, and we're very sensitive to making sure we deliver value for our customers in this particular time of need. As with any week, customers may see produce and meat prices fluctuate due to seasonal or market demand," it said in a statement.*<br />
It declined to elaborate on how much produce had fluctuated recently, saying it was too busy to answer this question.

Thu 26 Mar, 2020
:   Spaghetti and meatball meal tonight followed by some lovely banana blueberry dessert!<br />Cycled through the traffic cameras. It's kinda eerie how empty it is out there now. 

Fri 27 Mar, 2020
:   Maree's mentioned how odd it's been feeling having me work from home. We're in a combined bedroom/loungeroom/office so it's a close fit!

Sat 28 Mar, 2020
:   My order from Cheers arrived today! Got some drinks and essentials. Finished the night off with some Jackbox games over Discord; was great :D

Mon 30 Mar, 2020
:   Knowing full well that stores would be getting absolutely ransacked at the beginning of the lockdown, we made do with what we had with the plan to do a decent shop once the wave/horde has subsided. So bring on today! We've got an online shopping cart with over $300 worth of groceries. It took some time to create due to our local store being out of so many various items. We subbed out items here and there but still not even sure if the store will have what's left by Friday (delivery day)<br /><br />
Meanwhile, shoppers across the country are reporting inflated prices on some essential items. NZ PM Jacinda Ardern has tackeld this head on and set up a formal complaints inbox [pricewatch@mbie.govt.nz](#)<br />
*"No one wants to see anyone take unfair advantage of this extraordinary period,"* Ardern said. *"To be clear, **it is not illegal for businesses to increase their prices**, but the Fair Trading Act prohibits misleading and deceptive conduct and false representation."*<br .>
She said that means if a business gives a reason for a price increase, it must be true, otherwise the business risks breaching the Fair Trading Act, and that will be enforced. *"If retailers are taking advantage of their duopoly in the market, then we will act on that. That is illegal."*

Fri 3 Apr, 2020
:   **Fresh Delivery!** Today our supermarket order was delivered. Not a single item was missed although some minor swaps were made here and there to fulfill the order. Kudos to the shopper at the supermarket who did a great job on this order. Looks like we got our order in during a lucky period too, as the website is informing as of Monday it will be reserving deliveries for their Priority Assistance customers. Everyone else either wrestles for the pickup slots or makes the trip in and hope their items are in stock.

Sun 5 Apr, 2020
:   Maree baked a nice cake today. Not too much else happened but we're okay with a chillout day.

Thu 9 Apr, 2020 - Midday
:   Had a great virtual meetup with the Wellington Salesforce Community. Guest appearance by James Batup who previously worked in a senior role for LinkedIn and recently changed job to work at Salesforce instead. He gave a nice insight into the workings of LinkedIn and how to make best use of its features and abilities.

Thu 9 Apr, 2020 - Evening
:   **Shopping!** Went for a quick cruise down to our nearest Countdown; took less than 5 minutes to get there. Then waited in a line that circled most of the carpark. The waiting was not so bad but I only found out once it was my turn that people with click-and-collect orders can walk directly to the door. Well, I got some fresh air - that was nice.

Fri 10 Apr, 2020
:   **Happy Good Friday!** You know what? I think I'll stay home today... <br />
*I would continue but I'm pretty sure everyone is done with the 'not going to work' jokes already.*<br />
Anyway, I made some good headway with my Powershell API tool for GoFormz. Got a few more tweaks and bits to add in then it's ready for a heavy-lifting test.

Sat 11 Apr, 2020
:   So without a blender of any form (or even a whisk for that matter) it turns out making banana ice cream by hand is a no-go.
Good news though, we made heavy duty banana cake (triple the bananafication of normal cakes) which turned out pretty good.
<br/>And the icing on the cake... ***chocolate!*** ... *(subtle pun there)* <br />
Dinner is a nice serving of some homemade (including pastry) mushroom pie. Damn I have a great fiance :P

Sun 12 Apr, 2020
:    Movie night! Popcorn, nibbles and beanbag cuddles. Was a relaxing evening.

Wed 15 Apr, 2020
:    As always, we realised once we'd got our shopping there were some things we missed so we added these and our meal planner items to the new shopping list. Somehow, we scored luck and our supermarket had just the one slot available tomorrow evening.

Thu 16 Apr, 2020
:    Waiting outside for a supermarket delivery currently holds the same level of excitement for me as staring at Christmas presents at 7:50am when you're not allowed to start opening until 8am.
